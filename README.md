# High-Frequency Trader finder

Made for the [Who are the high-frequency traders ?](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/50/) challenge by *Autorité des Marchés Financiers*.

The `test_X`, `train_X` and `train_Y` files are expected to be located in a data folder at the root of this folder. 

The main code is contained in `experiments.ipynb`.
